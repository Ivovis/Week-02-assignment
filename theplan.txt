The Plan... 

Create the basic files - html css js
add containers to the html - add the js and css

Dig out a set of random pics from the clip art I made last year
 2 from three groups (there's a couple of thousand to pic from)
 ensure two of the same kind are different enough to need different alt texts
 place them into a media folder in the project root

create a mobile wireframe

create a desktop wireframe

js - create a media array to hold information about the gallery contents
    including filename and alternative text for each and the image index within the array    
    I could include a function here to loop through the array and update the id's to match the correct index, this would allow adding images to the gallery later

create a function to update the background image in the background container
    look for existing elements that have a class name used for the background image -> get its ID
    create the image using the index provided by the thumbnail listener - give it a classname "backgroundClass" and an ID of the index
    if an existing element was found it should be removed (maybe used for a transition effect later?)

Create a function that can populate the thumbnail container with images contained within the media array
    use a loop to cycle through the array
    create an element a or button
    attach the image
    attach the alt text
    attach a listener for mouse click that will call the the update background function passing the array index of the image to use for the update
        
At this point the css is mostly undefined but I want to have the call backs working and then work on the CSS to present what is needed

       
Note this would normally be excluded from git
